looking for linguistic differences between debate and dialogue

##Method and outline proposed:
#Parts of speech tagging/counting/Bag-of-Words: The Bag of Words model is a common, simple approach to natural language processing. The package takes a set of text, normalizes it (removing punctuation, very uncommon words, and the most common words), and counts each individual word. In doing so, it destroys the structure of the texts and looks discretely at how many words appear in each document. Bag of words normally removes stop words or the most common expression, but in this case, we will leave those words in to try and evaluate the different styles of the speakers, as well as look for language coordination (as described by Dajescu-Niculescu-Mizil). 
#Vectors/Continuous-Bag-of-Words: A second method of enquire will be conducted using the Doc2Vec and Word2Vec packages. Both packages examine the proximity of objects to other objects (either words to other words, or documents to other documents, or words within documents compared to words within other documents) to assign them a multidimensional vector. Vectors, being numbers, can be added and subtracted, or used to examine other numbers that may be closer to them or further apart. I hope this technique will reveal if words in the debate condition mean different things to the same words in the control and dialogue condition. I also hope to understand how close certain documents are to others (which is the most debate like conversation). 
#Human coding towards ML classification: I hope also to have a small training set coded, perhaps on the existing code book developed by Risen and Ward, in order to co-opt existing models of politeness, rudeness, or assertiveness and be able to identify markers on debate or dialogue on a larger corpus. It may be possible to leverage machine learning to code a large corpus like the Candor Corpus through semi-unsupervised learning, which could lead to new discoveries.  However, this may fall outside the scope of the project and will depend on my ability to leverage existing models. 
Algorithmic Analysis: Finally, I intend to run algorithmic analysis on my findings. I will leverage regression modelling to understand how prevalent these patterns are throughout the control groups, while examining the timing of their appearance on the dependent variable conditions. Through regression modelling I hope to learn if these types of linguistic markers are able to predict the outcomes of the experiment (how people feel after the experiment, if the participants achieve the idea outcome when using certain language, etc). Once my initial explorations have been completed, more interesting or novel regressions may present themselves. 
##Challenges: 
#Conversational data presents a number of challenges. There are at least two voices involved in a conversation, unlike in a web document, post, or letter, where there is generally one speaker, or a series of speakers with a single voice. This presents the first question that will need to be answered through my exploratory research: should the conversations be examined as individual documents, should each turn be examined, or the whole text from an individual speaker? Several authors provide insight into this, and it appears that different methods are suited for different purposes. As of my current understanding, I believe it may be best to code at a turn level (for example: Is this turn more or less dialogue? Is this turn exhibiting signs of debate) but examine at a conversation or speaker-based level. The disparity here is due to another two concerns: How will I account for the change in a participantâ€™s language over the course of a conversation or the influence of their partner? And, what will the scale of coding for dialogue and debate be? For example, the initial part of a conversation may be more like a dialogue, but things may escalate into a debate? Even in single turn or sentence, the tone may change. These questions will need to be answered through a deeper understanding of the current theories surrounding NLP and behavioural science as well as a series of exploratory trials (some of which have already begun, see Appendix C). I believe there empirical answers to how to deal with these problems, but they will need to be accounted for throughout my exploration and research. 
##Projected Results
#I imagine that there will be clear linguistic markers associated with the debate condition. I think we are likely to see many similarities between the dialogue and control condition. I believe that people often are unsure about how to be firm but amenable, so I imagine people will use less firm language in the control condition than in the dialogue condition. I would argue it will be possible to train a classifier to identify debate like speech on a turn-based level.
